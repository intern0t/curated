# Curated

News project built using React Redux, consumes NewsAPI.org's API endpoints.

This project was built to help me familarize with Redux for a collaborative upcoming project.

### Plans

1. -[x] Let user [provide](https://i.imgur.com/GdIthXN.png) an API key so that the production version doesn't consume my personal NewsAPI's daily limit.
1. -[x] Able to view API key stored in `localStorage` if exists & set up correctly from `Set API Key` section.
1. -[x] Pagination works great, added limiters & set up criteria when to paginate.
	1. -[x] Add Pagination on top of news wrapper.
1. -[ ] Store 3-5 (20*~3-5=**60-100 news**) pages as a cache to avoid multiple requests.
1. -[ ] Add **Scroll to top** button.
