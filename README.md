# Curated
News project built using React Redux, consumes NewsAPI.org's API endpoints.

This project was built to help me familarize with Redux for a collaborative upcoming project.

### Plans
1. -[x] Let user [provide](https://i.imgur.com/GdIthXN.png) an API key so that the production version doesn't consume my personal NewsAPI's daily limit.
1. -[ ] Store 3 pages as a cache to avoid multiple requests.
